;;; Commentary:

;; This library helps you to write brainfuck in Emacs.
;; It is also an example to define eldoc functions by using langdoc.
;;
;; Requirement:
;;    langdoc.el
;;
;; To use this package, add the following line to your .emacs file:
;;     (require 'bf-mode)
;; bf-mode highlights some keywords for usability.
;; By using M-x eldoc-mode, you can see the help string in minibuffer.
;; Also, by using M-x langdoc:describe-symbol (or C-c f), you can see
;; more documents for each command.
