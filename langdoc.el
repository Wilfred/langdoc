;;; Commentary:

;; This library helps you to define eldoc functions for various languages.
;; Here are the variables to be assigned.
;;
;; * `eldoc-documentation-function'
;;    If non-nil, function to call to return doc string.
;;    The function of no args should return a one-line string for displaying
;;    doc about a function etc. (quoted from docstring of this variable)
;; * `langdoc:pointed-symbol-fn'
;;    Function name which returns the string pointed by
;;    the cursor.  This function recieves no arguments.
;; * `langdoc:symbols'
;;    List of strings which is used to complete words.
;; * `langdoc:helpbuf'
;;    Buffer name to show the help string.
;; * `langdoc:make-document-fn'
;;    Function name which return the help string.
;;    This function recieves the string to show help.
;;
;; If you need a concrete example, see the definition of `bf-mode' in bf-mode.el.
